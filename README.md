## Samaritan
A possible solution to decentralized identity

The idea is to build a layer beneath the user space but above the very kernel of an OS, that can communicate with a Substrate chain and other decentralized infrastructures e.g for storage.

So the apps running on a Samaritan Os for instance, would just get the ID of the User(Samaritan) and then request what it wants from the OS, and if the permission is granted, if what is needed is online, the OS fetches it and presents it to the program.

What should be done:
A way to communicate with a substrate sanaritan chain should be created.
Also the chain itself and what state it keeps should be defined.
Apps are also represented onchain.
